    "questionText": "Read the following Text (1 & 2) and answer the following question: Text 1: Social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate, offering instant connectivity and a platform for sharing information and ideas. However, concerns have been raised about the negative impact of social media on mental health, particularly among teenagers. Studies have linked excessive social media use to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Text 2: Psychologist Dr. Srivastava conducted a study to explore the relationship between social media use and mental health. She found that the impact of social media on mental health varies depending on how it is used. For example, active engagement, such as meaningful interactions and content creation, was associated with positive mental health outcomes, while passive consumption, such as scrolling through feeds without interaction, was linked to negative mental health outcomes. Based on the texts, how would Dr. Srivastava (Text 2) most likely respond to the concerns about social media's impact on mental health discussed in Text 1?",
